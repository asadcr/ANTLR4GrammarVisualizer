# grunsharp
A C#/WPF implementation of grun, the ANTLR grammar test rig.

As it stands, this is a very basic/rough implementation, but it's enough to run the C# parser/lexer files generated by the ANTLR tool, meaning you can write your additional grammar logic in C# from beginning to end without losing out on being able to use the test rig.

## Usage
`grunsharp.exe <grammar name> <start rule> <input files>... [--gui] [--tokens] [--config=<path>]`

Run from the working directory (containing your generated .cs parser/lexer files).

### Config
Optionally, a `gruncs.json` file can be placed in the working directory (or at a path supplied through the `--config` option).

An example config file:
```json
{
    "References": [
        "System.Core",
        "System.Text.RegularExpressions"
    ],
    "Include": [
        "AdditionalLogic.extra.cs"
    ]
}
```

- **References**: A list of assemblies to reference, in 3 possible formats:
  - Full name (e.g. [Assembly.FullName](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assembly.fullname.aspx))
  - Filepath of the assembly
  - As a last resort, the loader will attempt [Assembly.LoadWithPartialName()](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/12xc5368.aspx)
- **Include**: Any additional files (relative paths) to be compiled before the parser is run
